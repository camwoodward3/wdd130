                <p>Super Mario is a platform games series created by Nintendo on October 1985, starring the mascot, Mario. It is the central series of the greater Mario franchise. At least one Super Mario game has been released for every major Nintendo console. There are more than 20 games in the series.</p>
                <p>The game is set primarily in the Mushroom Kingdom, typically with Mario being the player character, along with his brother, Luigi, and other members of the Mario cast. The games involve the player character running and jumping across platforms and atop enemies in themed levels. The games have simple plots, typically with Mario, Luigi, and sometimes other characters rescuing the kidnapped Princess Peach from the primary antagonist, Bowser. The first game in the series, Super Mario Bros., establishd the series' core gameplay concepts and elements. These include a multitude of power-ups and items that give the character special powers such as fireball-throwing and size-changing. </p>
